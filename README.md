In recent years, e-commerce in Southeast Asia has garnered considerable attention. The advancements in e-commerce within these countries have been rapid, witnessing a growing user base and escalating sales. The aim of this research is to analyze the factors influencing monthly sales volume in e-commerce companies operating across several Southeast Asian nations. Utilizing variables such as monthly sales volume (y), number of website visitors per month (x1), number of monthly transactions (x2), average number of items per transaction (x3), customer satisfaction rating (x4), and number of online advertisements run per month (x5), the goal is to identify hidden patterns, market trends, and customer preferences. E-commerce has emerged as an alternative for people to shop while avoiding crowds. The progress of e-commerce in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, has captured our attention. Presently, the most visited e-commerce trends among Indonesian consumers include Bukalapak, Tokopedia, and Shopee.

By comprehending the relationship among these variables, we can optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer experiences, and bolster overall profitability. In this context, itâ€™s crucial to understand the association among the provided variables and identify potential patterns. For instance, high sales figures may indicate marketing success and customer engagement, whereas high customer retention scores might signal customer satisfaction with products and services. By understanding the interplay among these variables, we can pinpoint areas for improvement and optimize marketing strategies to elevate sales and customer satisfaction.
